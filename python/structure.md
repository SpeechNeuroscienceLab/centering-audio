# Structure

This file is for planning purposes only. 

The input for the python "main" program should be some file that contains the
table of values that will also be used for calculating stats. This file can be supplied as an argument into the command line, or can be responded from a prompt. 
Each figure will be called by its own function. The same goes for generating any supplementary tables. The reason for this is that I found myself removing many figures, modifying them, and keeping many intermediate versions. 

For now, the preprocessor should be kept as the matlab scripts because I'm not familiar enough with the C-based utility at this point in time. This will remain as a hybrid between python and matlab. I hope that in the future, I'll be able to port the entire project to python.
